Compression and decompression run faster than realtime\r\non most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the\r\nETSI standard test patterns.\r\n\r\nJutta Degener (jutta@cs.tu-berlin.de)\r\nCarsten Bormann (cabo@cs.tu-berlin.de)\r\n\r\nCommunications and Operating Systems Research Group, TU Berlin\r\nFax: +49.30.31425156, Phone: +49.30.31424315\r\n\r\n--\r\nCopyright 1992 by Jutta Degener and Carsten Bormann, Technische\r\nUniversitaet Berlin.
